## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to build a webpage for users to interact with ufo sighting data.  The raw data is read from a .js file provided by the client.  The webpage was also required to have a multi-filter area for a user to enter values.  These values will then filter the raw sighting data into a reduced table for faster review by the user.
